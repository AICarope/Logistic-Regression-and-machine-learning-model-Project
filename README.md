# Capstone Project
In Progress - Develop a Logistic Regression machine learning model to predict heart attack risk in female populations, focusing on identifying key predictive factors such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, obesity, and stress, and understanding their interrelationships. Using a dataset from Kaggle containing 8,763 patient entries, with 2,652 female patients, the goal is to accurately predict heart attack risk based on health metrics, lifestyle factors, and medical history. The model will be evaluated using Pythong for metrics as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. By tailoring this model to womenâ€™s unique cardiovascular risk factors, the project seeks to improve early detection, personalized treatment, and clinical practices related to heart disease in women.

#TO DO
#create percentages in the value counts
#create x and y
#create distribution for sex and age graph
#filter the data set just for women
    # Filter the DataFrame for only females
    # Female_data = all_heart_df1[all_heart_df1['sex'] == 'Female']
#Target Variable (Y):

#In this dataset, the target variable for heart attack risk is typically the output column.
#The output column indicates whether the patient is at risk of a heart attack:
#0: No heart attack
#1: Heart attack

#Feature Variables (X):

#The following columns from the dataset can be used as features to predict heart attack (inputs for X):
#age: Age of the patient
#cp: Chest pain type (4 values)
#trtbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
thalachh: Maximum heart rate achieved
exng: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slp: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
caa: Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy
thall: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
Based on this, your X will consist of these features:

python
Copy code
X = female_data[['age', 'cp', 'trtbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalachh', 'exng', 'oldpeak', 'slp', 'caa', 'thall']]
Full Example Code:
python
Copy code
# Assuming you've already filtered the data for females
female_data = all_heart_df1[all_heart_df1['sex'] == 'Female']

# Define X (input features) and Y (target variable)
X = female_data[['age', 'cp', 'trtbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalachh', 'exng', 'oldpeak', 'slp', 'caa', 'thall']]
Y = female_data['output']

# Now X contains the features and Y contains the target
print(X.head())  # Display the first few rows of X
print(Y.head())  # Display the first few rows of Y

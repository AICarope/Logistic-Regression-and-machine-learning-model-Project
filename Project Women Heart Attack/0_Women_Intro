Content
This synthetic dataset provides a comprehensive array of features relevant to heart health and lifestyle choices, encompassing patient-specific details such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and indicators like diabetes, family history, smoking habits, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Additionally, lifestyle factors like exercise hours, dietary habits, stress levels, and sedentary hours are included. Medical aspects comprising previous heart problems, medication usage, and triglyceride levels are considered. Socioeconomic aspects such as income and geographical attributes like country, continent, and hemisphere are incorporated. The dataset, consisting of 8763 records from patients around the globe, culminates in a crucial binary classification feature denoting the presence or absence of a heart attack risk, providing a comprehensive resource for predictive analysis and research in cardiovascular health.
